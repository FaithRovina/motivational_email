# motivational_email
This is a program that sends motivational quotes via email using Simple Mail Transfer Protocol in Python. To try the code, you can fill in the sender and recipient's email and the sender email's password. This mini-project is part of the projects that I worked on in the 100 days of Code Challenge by Angela Yu on Udemy.
